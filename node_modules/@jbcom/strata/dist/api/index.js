/**
 * @jbcom/strata API
 *
 * Strata organizes its API into six domains based on how you'll use them:
 *
 * ## Domains
 *
 * ### {@link world | World Building}
 * Terrain, water, vegetation, sky, and atmosphere - the foundation of your 3D environment.
 *
 * ### {@link entities | Entities & Simulation}
 * Characters, physics, animation, and AI - dynamic objects that move and interact.
 *
 * ### {@link effects | Effects & Atmosphere}
 * Particles, weather, decals, lighting effects - visual polish that brings scenes to life.
 *
 * ### {@link experience | Player Experience}
 * Cameras, input, audio, and UI - how players see, control, hear, and understand your game.
 *
 * ### {@link systems | Game Systems}
 * State management, save/load, checkpoints - the infrastructure powering your game.
 *
 * ### {@link rendering | Rendering Pipeline}
 * Shaders, post-processing, materials - low-level graphics for advanced customization.
 *
 * ## Quick Start
 *
